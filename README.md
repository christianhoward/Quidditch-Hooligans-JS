# Quidditch Hooligans in JavaScript
One of my classes in Fall 2017 had us take an [old project](https://github.com/christianhoward/lab3laravel) and implement it using the Laravel framework instead of vanilla PHP. During my Full-Stack Javascript independent study in Spring 2017, I decided to implement this same project using Full-Stack Javascript.

The single page application uses CRUD to create, update, delete, and display Quidditch players from a MongoDB database. The application uses a blank container and has two buttons to toggle between a table of players and a form to add/update players. This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://quidditch-hooligans.herokuapp.com/) if you are interested in testing it out.
